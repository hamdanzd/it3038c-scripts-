Hello, I'm Zaid Hamdan, a fifth-year student majoring in cybersecurity. I'm planning to graduate in the spring of 2024
I'm interested in robotics and troubleshooting technical issues. I'm a big fan of engineering and mechanical devices. Additionally, I enjoy taking nighttime walks while listening to music.
I'm currently learning Python, scripting and network building.
I'm looking to collaborate on projects and scripting assignments with other students, as it's not my favorite subject.
You can reach me via email at hamdanzd@mail.uc.edu.
